# Technical Task for Full Stack Developer

This technical task is an opportunity for you to show us the technical skills, creativity 
and communication we could expect if you were to become part of the Developer team here at Geomiq.

Elements of this task are real, taken straight from our backlog!

**Main task**

Create a file upload form that Geomiq customers can use for uploading their 3d print part designs.

The form should allow a customer to upload a part and see a thumbnail image of the uploaded part.

Two example 3d print files for uploading to the form are provided.

**Constraints:**

1. Bleeding-edge Laravel and Vue.js 
2. Don’t use bootstrap css
3. Use the laravel filesystem
4. No need for any auth scaffolding – customers can all be assumed to be ‘guest’

**Output:**

Please provide your project to us in a manner that is easy for us to review. If using a git repo then please name it using your own name.

Along with your submission, please respond on the following:

**Written Questions:**

1. Summarise your approach, explaining any decisions and assumptions taken.
2. How could you improve the UX of your form?
3. If given another 24 hours on this – What would you do?
